The main objective of this master thesis is to use DNA methylation-based biomarkers and aging to evaluate the influence of noise and missing measurements on the
prediction accuracy. We will implement different models to answer at those following questions : Which model is the best in term of accuracy and prediction ?
Will models fall because of the lack of robustness and thus what is the most robust
model? How much quantity of noise do we need to see a consequent diminution
of accuracy on our predictions? Are missing values most destructive for data than
noise ?

I didn't touch any of the code or comments in the code since the 3 last months.
